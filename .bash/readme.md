1. [User Privileges](#User-Privileges)
2. [The Essentials](#Essential-Commands)
3. [Setting up the Environment](#Setting-up-the-Environment)
4. [Scripting](#Scripting)

## User Privileges

- `sudo` **root**
- `su` **super user**
- `$` **standard**

## Essential Commands

### [Man Pages](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~guide/help/man.html)

Man pages are the standard documentation for every Unix

**Note:** The default pager for reading a man page is `less`

- type `man man` for information of man references
- type `man` or `info` following with the search query for man references
- type `/` following with the search query within man references
- type `man -k` following with the search query for **related man references**

### Best Practice

- use `curl` for **single** files, use `wget` for **multiple** files
- use `pushd` for **navigation** on the call stack, `popd` to remove from stack
- use `ls` for **navigation**, use `find` in **scripting**
- use `cat` for **text** files, use `ffmpeg` for **encoded media** files
- use `ls` not `cd` when **piping for a file in a directory**

### Navigation

- type `ls` to show directory contents
- type `ls -l` to show all directory contents and permissions
- type `cd` for current directory
- type `cd ..` to go up one directory
- type `pwd` to print working directory

### Directory

- type `~` or `$HOME` for the home directory
- type `/` for the root directory

### System Information

- type `whoami` to display current user
- type `hostname` to output the hostname
- type `uname -m` to determine architecture
- type `sudo blkid` to show disk partition information
- type `screenfetch` to display system information
- type `diskutil list` to list all partitions
- type `sudo systemsetup -liststartupdisks`
- type `sudo systemsetup -setstartupdisk /Volumes/YOUR_SYS_VOLUME_NAME`
- type `sudo systemsetup -getstartupdisk`

### System Events

- type `sudo reboot` to reboot system
- type `poweroff` to power off system
- type `sudo shutdown -r now` to shutdown and restart right now
- type `osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to restart'` to invoke
  System Events to restart
- type `osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to shut down'` to invoke
  System Events to shut down

### Copy

- type `cat <file1> <file2> <file3> > merged_file` to merge files together
- type `cp /full/path/to/<filename> -r /destination/path/` to copy file(s) and
  sub-files and paste in new folder
- use `-rLt` flags to
  [recursively copy files in a directory to the directory source (for symlinks)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/c9wz5h/unexpected_result_copying_files_and_symlinks/)
  on any POSIX-conformant cp implementation, where `-L` follows symbolic links
  when copying from them. POSIX leaves it unspecified whether symbolic links are
  by default followed during a recursive copy

### Move

- type `mv <file> <newlocation>` to move files
- `pushd`, `popd` (to move across directory)

### Alias

- type `ln -s /path/to/original/ /path/to/link` to create an alias

### Remove

- type `sudo rm <file> -r or -rf` to recursively remove files
- avoid the
  [catastrophic doomsday scenario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sonKLFb_-d0)
  of `rm -rf / --no-preserve-root`. Take preventative measures with
  `brew install safe-rm` or `sudo apt-get install safe-rm` or work within a
  virtual machine... unless you are intending on wiping your system anyway ðŸ˜Ž

### History

- type `history` to show all previous commands
- commands that start with a `space` aren't logged in history
- type `history | grep <command>` to query a list of commands using that keyword

### Exit Status

**Note:** An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value
indicates failure.

- type the command
- type `echo $?` to display the [exit code](exitcode.csv) (0-255; 0 = success,
  1-255 = fail)

  file size of the entry matches that of the OS file, the entry is copied from
  the old archive instead of being read from the file system and compressed. If
  the OS file has changed, the entry is read and compressed as usual. If the
  entry in the archive does not match a file on the OS, the entry is deleted; an
  alternative to `-u` except removes _removed_ files from the zip archive

- type `-g` to grow (append to) the specified zip archive, instead of creating a
  new one. If this operation fails, zip attempts to restore the archive to its
  original state. If the restoration fails, the archive might become corrupted.
  This option is ignored when there's no existing archive or when at least one
  archive member must be updated or deleted.

### Replace cover.jpg | .epub

- change the filename .epub -> .zip
- in terminal, type `unzip -l filename.zip` to view folder contents without
  unzipping
- in current directory, create the same directory tree as is the location of the
  cover.jpg in the existing file.zip.
- for example, if `cover.jpg` is in `filename.zip/sub1/sub2/cover.jpg` then
  create a directory tree in your current directory like `sub1/sub2/cover.jpg`
- type `zip filename.zip sub1/sub2/cover.jpg`, zip will then replace the file
- note: `zip` only replaces files that already exist in the .zip file
